    If you get "could not launch process: could not fork/exec", you need to try
    in a new terminal.

    When uninstalling, to remove the dlv-cert certificate, run this command:

        $ sudo security delete-certificate -t -c dlv-cert /Library/Keychains/System.keychain

    Alternatively, you may want to delete from the Keychain (with the Imported private key).
